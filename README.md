## NYC Payroll for Tech vs Top non-tech departments

## The realm of public sector employment and compensation is a complex and multifaceted area, often reflecting broader socio-economic dynamics. Meanwhile, in the era of rapid technological advancement, the role of technology departments in public administration has become increasingly pivotal. Our capstone project centers on a detailed examination of the Citywide Payroll Data (Fiscal Year) for New York City, with a specific focus on the Technology Department. This project is an embodiment of applying theoretical knowledge acquired in our course to a real-world context, offering practical insights into the dynamics of employment and compensation in the technology sector of public service.
The primary objective of this analysis is to explore various facets of the payroll structure within the Technology Department of New York City's administration. 

<br>
### Our goals include:
Investigating the factors that influence salary disparities among employees within the Technology Department.
<br>

## Assessing the distribution and impact of overtime hours on compensation in technology roles.
Evaluating the predictability of an employeeâ€™s salary bracket based on their role and other relevant factors within the Technology Department.
This analysis aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the compensation mechanisms in a critical sector of public administration, offering insights that could inform policy and operational strategies in the technology realm. To achieve these goals, we have delineated the following questions:
<br>

## 1) What factors contribute to the variations in salaries within the Technology Department?
## 2) How does the allocation of overtime hours vary among different roles within the Technology Department?
## 3) What is the relationship between overtime pay and total compensation for various technology-focused job titles?
## 4) Can we use job titles, departmental roles, and other variables to predict salary brackets for employees in the Technology Department?

<br>
## Our approach to addressing these questions will include:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting an initial exploration of the dataset to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies specific to the Technology Department.
Predictive Modeling: Applying linear regression to predict salaries, classification models to categorize employees into different salary brackets, and time-series analysis to understand compensation trends over time within the Technology Department.
This methodological approach will ensure a detailed and nuanced exploration of the dataset, enabling us to derive substantive conclusions and recommendations pertinent to the technology sector in public administration.
